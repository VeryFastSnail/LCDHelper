# LCDHelperThis is tool for LCD graphics generation

By designing this app I have one goal in mind: Make LCD menus, buttons and other elements easy! At this point I'm bored of creating UI for TFT OLEDS and other screens.

This is what I'm currently working on:
1. Package manager fo simple packages instalation and sharing between users.
2. Visual screen outline (shows screen frame for simplicity)
3. Simple basic elements (lines, suqares, triangles, circles, etc...)
4. More advanced models (frames, hexagons, buttons, progressbars and so on)
5. Code compilation for arduino boards.
6. Saving and loading.


What I would like to implement in the future:
1. Libraries manager for code bases other that Adafruit GFX's
2. AVRDUDE, UPDI and other upload protocols for in app in hardware testing.
